/*write a program for the room reservation:
            King Bed ==> 120$
            Queen Bed ==> 100$
            single Bed ==> 80$
            the program asks the user which bedroom does he/she wants to reserve and calculats the total price
            and then the program will ask:
                do you want to reserve another room:
                            if yes ==> repeat the previous steps
                            if no ==> your total price is: $$$
                            while answer is neither yes or no ==> please re-enter
